# Ohayo!

I **love** refactoring code.

If you know repos that need some, send me their location and I'll get them clean!

**Do you know Daily.dev?**

It's a useful extension that shows you recent dev articles and enable you to generate a cool card such as this one!

## Projects I dropped into the wild

### Izir

Izir is an hybrid mobile app.

It allows shop owners from New Caledonia to manage their shop and be visible in 6 different languages including:
- French
- English
- Japanese
- Chinese
- Korean and
- Vietnamese.

As only about a fifth of this island' shops have an online presence, I thought that it would be useful to have such a tool and improve things.

Plus, you can directly (from the app) interact with shops (shop owners in fact! you won't speak with walls won't you?!) from within the app.  
This means that you no longer need to know the Facebook page of a shop, nor its email address or phone number.

You'll have one medium to converse with them and it'll be simpler for everyone.


### Marvelous Matcha

You love matcha?

Or wonder what it is?

You think that [this comic](https://medium.com/slackjaw/coffee-people-vs-tea-people-b14a54714167) strip is true?
Let's make it even more.

I created this blog (link coming soon!) to teach people how to master making matcha!
